            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="text-success">I</span> have always had a natural inclination toward technology since I was an adolescent, starting with my family's very first PC &dash; a Dell Dimensions XPS tower with a 56k modem (high speed internet access at the time). I was so intrigued by it, I banded with other like-minded tech enthusiasts like myself in order to take it apart and put it back together again. Eventually, this sparked my interest in designing and building custom made computers with specifically chosen components so that I could overclock the processor and GPU to score high benchmark scores. This hobby of mine carried well into high school and college, such that once I graduated and was looking for employment, I gravitated toward positions in the IT field.</p>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="text-success">D</span>espite not having any formal education or certification in technology, I impressed my first boss with my skills in troubleshooting computer-related issues that I got my first job in tech as an IT technician at an SEO company called 29&acute; Prime in Irvine, California. It was a fast yet heavy introduction to the world of enterprise IT technology and I learned so much that it solidified my foundation in everything IT, including networking. This experience landed me my next position at a private aviation company next to John Wayne Airport called JetSuite Inc., which was the best experience I had. Not only was it an exciting cross-section of business to be involved in (aviation plus IT), it included some amazing perks, such as free travel for work-related business on private jet planes flying out of private hangars to locations all across California and Las Vegas. I had my first taste of coding when I was tasked with helping the Flight Operations department send out text message alerts to passengers regarding flight delays (at the time, they were individually texting each passenger, which you can imagine was very time consuming). So I ended up writing a Windows batch script that would prompt the user for the phone number of the passenger and the message they intened to send, and it would send that message to the specified phone number via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).</p>

            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="text-success">S</span>adly, the company re-located to Dallas, Texas. But this was also around the time that I started to question if I still had the desire to continue working in IT because my passion for the job started to wane. That is when I started looking into computer science and programming as a career. I immediately got in contact with the admissions director of the Master of Computer Science program at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), in order to inquire about the pre-requisites required to gain acceptance into the program. With her help, I took all the required courses and was very fortunate to be accepted into the program. What I loved about this program was that it was for working professionals, so it had a great, supportive career advisory staff, and it was only a year-long, meaning no accruing of large student debt. By the end of it, I learned so much about scientific computing, machine learning, data structures, computer architecture, database design, and networking theory. However, it lacked any class offerings in web development, which I was always interested in learning.</p>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="text-success">T</span>his led me to the coding boot academy Learning Fuze in Irvine after graduating from UCI. Out of all the places I researched, I knew this program was the best one and my belief was confirmed after matriculation. The instructors were so knowledgeable and more importantly passionate about teaching, using methods that really helped you understand the concept being taught. And that brings me to the conclusion of my developer's story thus far, but it continues to write itself as my career evolution proceeds to the next chapter...</p>
